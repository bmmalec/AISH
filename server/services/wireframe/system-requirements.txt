To decompose the system based on the given requirements, here's how we can structure the components:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "frontend": [
      "register.html",
      "login.html",
      "dashboard.html"
    ],
    "backend": [
      {
        "name": "authService.js",
        "description": "Handles user registration, login, authentication, and session management."
      },
      {
        "name": "userService.js",
        "description": "Manages user data like profile information, settings, etc."
      }
    ],
    "database": [
      {
        "name": "User",
        "description": "Stores user details like email, hashed password, registration date, etc."
      },
      {
        "name": "Session",
        "description": "Manages session tokens for authenticated users."
      }
    ]
  }
]


### Explanation:

- **Frontend**: 
  - `register.html`: A page where new users can register their account with an email and password.
  - `login.html`: A login page for existing users to authenticate themselves.
  - `dashboard.html`: A dashboard where users can view their family data after logging in.

- **Backend**: 
  - `authService.js`: This service would deal with:
    - User registration, validating input, hashing passwords, and storing user data.
    - User authentication when logging in, checking credentials against the database.
    - Session management to keep track of logged-in users.
  - `userService.js`: This service would manage user-related operations post-authentication like profile updates, account settings, etc.

- **Database**: 
  - **User Model**: Contains fields like `id`, `email`, `password` (hashed), `registration_date`, etc.
  - **Session Model**: Keeps track of active sessions with fields like `session_id`, `user_id`, `token`, `expiry_time`.

This structure ensures that each component has its responsibilities clearly defined, promoting modularity and maintainability in the system design.

      },
      {
        "type": "database",
        "name": "Session"
      }
    ]
  }
]


### Explanation:

- **Requirement ID 1**: This requirement states the need for user registration, authentication, and secure access to family data. Here's how it maps to components:
  - **Frontend**: 
    - `register.html` is where users register, directly related to the user account creation requirement.
    - `login.html` is for user login, which ties into authentication.
    - `dashboard.html` allows access to family data once authenticated, ensuring privacy.
  - **Backend**: 
    - `authService.js` handles the entire lifecycle of user authentication from registration to session management, aligning with the objective of secure authentication.
    - `userService.js` manages user data post-authentication, ensuring that user profiles and settings are managed securely.
  - **Database**: 
    - The **User** model stores critical information needed for authentication like email and hashed passwords.
    - The **Session** model tracks user sessions to manage access to family data, ensuring that only authorized users can interact with the data. 

This matrix helps in understanding how each component contributes to fulfilling the system requirements, thereby aiding in design, development, and testing phases to ensure all requirements are met by the appropriate system components.

                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]


This decomposition:

- **Frontend**: Provides interfaces for users to interact with the system, including forms for creating a family and inviting members.
- **Backend**: Manages the logic for processing family creation, sending invitations, and handling member roles and authentication.
- **Database**: Stores necessary data to support the functionality, including family details, member relations, and invitation tracking. 

This setup ensures that the system meets the requirement of simplifying family creation and enhancing connectivity by providing a streamlined user experience with all necessary backend support and data storage.

To decompose the system requirement "FR-006" into components, we'll consider how each aspect of the requirement can be handled by different layers of an application:

[
  {
    "id": "FR-006",
    "category": "Data",
    "description": "Family members can be added or removed by the family creator or admin.",
    "components": [
      {
        "frontend": [
          {
            "name": "familyManagementScreen.html",
            "description": "Screen for adding or removing family members, including UI elements for user input and confirmation dialogs."
          }
        ],
        "backend": [
          {
            "name": "familyService.js",
            "description": "Service to handle CRUD operations on family members. Includes authentication checks to ensure only the family creator or admin can make changes."
          }
        ],
        "database": [

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]


Here's a breakdown of the components:

- **Frontend**: 
  - `familyManagementScreen.html` - This would be where users interact to manage family members. It would include forms or interfaces for adding new members or removing existing ones, along with necessary UI elements like buttons, text inputs, and perhaps a confirmation modal.

- **Backend**:
  - `familyService.js` - This service would contain methods for:
    - `addFamilyMember(familyId, userId)` - Adds a new member to the family.
    - `removeFamilyMember(familyId, userId)` - Removes a member from the family, with checks for permissions.
    - `getFamilyMembers(familyId)` - Retrieves members of a family for display or verification.

- **Database**:
  - `FamilyMember` - A table or collection to keep track of each individual member, linked by foreign keys or references to users and families.
  - `Family` - This model would include information about the family itself, like who the creator or admin is, possibly with roles or permissions associated with family management.

This structure ensures that each part of the system (frontend, backend, database) works together to fulfill the requirement while maintaining separation of concerns.

                }
            }
        }
    }
]


### Explanation:

- **Frontend**: 
  - **Screens**: Separate views for adding chores, listing chores, and viewing chore details.
  - **Components**: Reusable UI components like forms for entering chore data, list items for chores, and a date picker for due dates.

- **Backend**: 
  - **Services**: JavaScript files handling business logic like creating, reading, updating, or deleting chores, and authentication services for user management.
  - **Controllers**: Handle incoming requests and pass them to the appropriate service.
  - **Routes**: Define the API endpoints for chore operations.

- **Database**:
  - **Models**: SQL or NoSQL schema definitions for `Chore` and `User`.
  - **Schema**: Detailed structure for each model, specifying field types and relationships. Here, `Chore` has fields for all necessary chore details, and `User` is included to manage who created or is assigned to a chore. 

This structure ensures that each part of the application has clear responsibilities, promoting modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

Here is the traceability matrix linking each requirement to its corresponding components:

[
    {

                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]


### Explanation:

- **Frontend**: 
  - All screens (`AddChoreScreen.js`, `ChoreListScreen.js`, `ChoreDetailScreen.js`) and components (`ChoreForm.jsx`, `ChoreItem.jsx`, `DatePicker.jsx`) are involved in logging chores, displaying chores, and managing due dates.

- **Backend**: 
  - `choreService.js` for CRUD operations on chores, `ChoreController.js` for handling requests, and `choreRoutes.js` for defining the API endpoints related to chores.

- **Database**: 
  - The `Chore` model and schema are used directly for storing and managing chore data as per the requirement for logging chores with details like name, description, and due date. The `User` model might be indirectly involved for user authentication and assignment but not directly for the chore logging functionality.

This traceability matrix ensures that each requirement is addressed by specific components across the system's architecture, facilitating traceability and verification of how each requirement is met by the software components.

]

```

## decompose-6
```
To decompose the system described in the given requirement into frontend, backend, and database components, here's how we could structure the components:

[
  {
    "id": "F-001",
    "components": [
      {
        "frontend": [
          "offlineSyncScreen.html",
          "syncStatusIndicator.js"
        ],
        "backend": [
          "dataSyncService.js",
          "offlineDataService.js"
        ],
        "database": [
          "UserDataModel",
          "SyncStatusModel"
        ]
      }
    ],

    "benefit": "Maintains app usability in areas with poor connectivity.",
    "objective": "Ensure continuous access.",
    "value": "Improves user experience and accessibility."
  }
]


### Explanation:

- **Frontend Components:**
  - `offlineSyncScreen.html`: This would be a user interface where users can view offline data, possibly initiate sync processes, or check sync status.
  - `syncStatusIndicator.js`: A script to display the current sync status, perhaps through visual cues or notifications.

- **Backend Components:**
  - `dataSyncService.js`: A service responsible for handling the synchronization of data between the client and server, including strategies for conflict resolution, batch syncing, etc.
  - `offlineDataService.js`: Handles data operations when offline, managing data storage and retrieval locally, and preparing data for syncing.

- **Database Components:**
  - `UserDataModel`: This model would manage user-specific data that needs to be stored, synced, and accessed both online and offline.
  - `SyncStatusModel`: Tracks the status of data syncing, last sync time, pending sync operations, etc., which could be useful for both frontend status indicators and backend sync logic.

This decomposition ensures that each part of the system handles its responsibilities in providing a seamless offline and online experience for the users.
