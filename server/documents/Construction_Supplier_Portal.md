# Project: Construction_Supplier_Portal

## Vision
To create a supplier portal platform that can be used by General contractors other independent contractors that would be used in the construction of commerical buildings. The portal will establish the rules and regulations to be part of the construction program. It would use a scorecarding system, and evaluation of supplier performance. It will be critical for the suppliers to not only commit for job work, but also any working materials and supplies needed to complete the job. From a construction plan, that can span many years, it would be important for current and future allocation of supplies and resources be tracked and accounted for. From this a live heterogenous warehouse management of inventory would be tracked and reported on. Based on supplier performance, future work can be given to more proven providers.

## Scope
Create a system that allows for not just tracking the suppliers but also their inventory of supplies needed. The supplier will need an onboarding process, collecting information, certifications, and other related documents and contractual terms. Once onboarded, they will be given visibility to scopes of work, they will have the details to bid on those scopes of work, labor, material type, quantity, and cost. Once they are selected, for the given scopes of work, they will be required to confirm scheduling and material inventory level, so if a work order requires 100 power outlets, the supplier will give details on their supply and planned fulfillment of the supply before beginning. The scope of work should go through planning, detailed estimation, review, and other supporting milestones required for construction, such as permitting and inspections. Create views for supplier status reviews, construction milestone reviews, costing, planning, and forecasting review for entire program. There should also be a risk management and change management processes to handle issues that come up during construction.
