  "projectName": "Amtrak_-_System_Analysis",
  "vision": "Amtrak would like to evaluate its WIMS inventory system that is used to manage their 11 Commissaries to support their Food and Beverage operations onboard their train network. The platform is given train route and passenger levels with considerations for meal requirements, i.e. vegan or special events. The trains may run a combination of routes that put them outside of the commissary network, requiring them to ensure they top off inventory to handle the entire route. This platform also communicates with other systems such as pick to light, and potentially voice pick in the future. This system analysis should establish an as-is state, documenting existing capabilities, baselining operations, and capture any future capabilities or challenges. This should also involve processes to review operations at each commissary to collect as-is state, document and validate documentation of operations, and vision and scope of current and potentially future operating and systems procedures.",
  "scope": "To establish an inventory and \"As-Is\" state of systems, processes, and operating procedures used in the execution. This will also include benchmarking existing operational and systems efforts to their overall impact of P&L of Food and Beverage operations from a cost of goods sold perspective. Create project plan to execute and finally report to operations on findings and potential program roadmap.",
