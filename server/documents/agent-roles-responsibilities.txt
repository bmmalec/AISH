# Standards Document for AI Agent Roles and Responsibilities

## 1. Purpose
This document outlines the roles and responsibilities of AI agents involved in transforming stakeholder requirements into a web application solution. It specifies tasks, their purposes, standards, dependencies, deliverable formats, and recipients, ensuring a coordinated effort to produce artifacts for UX Designers, Solution Architects, Tech Leads, Developer Leads, QA Leads, Product Owners, and Stakeholders.

## 2. AI Agent Roles and Responsibilities

### 2.1. Requirement Analyst Agent (RAA)
- **Purpose**: Interpret and structure stakeholder requirements for system design.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Task 1: Requirement Categorization**
    - **Purpose**: Organize requirements by functionality to guide system design.
    - **Standards**: Assign unique IDs (e.g., R-001), categorize (e.g., UI, data, integration), preserve description, benefit, objective, value.
    - **Dependencies**: Stakeholder input (raw requirements).
    - **Deliverable**: Categorized requirement list (JSON or text).
    - **Recipient**: Product Owner (validation), System Design Agent (input).
  - **Deliverable Standards**:
    - Format: JSON (e.g., `[{ "id": "R-001", "category": "UI", "description": "...", ... }]`)
    - Clarity: Each requirement tagged with ID and category.
    - Completeness: Include all provided fields (description, benefit, objective, value).

### 2.2. System Design Agent (SDA)
- **Purpose**: Define system components and architecture from requirements.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Task 1: System Decomposition**
    - **Purpose**: Break system into components (frontend, backend, DB, integrations).
    - **Standards**: Use MVC pattern, modularize (e.g., services in `server/services/`), align with requirement categories.
    - **Dependencies**: Categorized requirements from RAA.
    - **Deliverable**: Component list with descriptions (text or pseudo-diagram).
    - **Recipient**: Solution Architect (review), Screen Design Agent (input).
  - **Task 2: Mapping Requirements**
    - **Purpose**: Link requirements to components for traceability.
    - **Standards**: Create a traceability matrix, ensure benefit/objective drives design.
    - **Dependencies**: Categorized requirements from RAA, components from Task 1.
    - **Deliverable**: Traceability matrix (text table or JSON).
    - **Recipient**: Tech Lead (validation), Artifact Generation Agent (input).
  - **Deliverable Standards**:
    - Component List: Text (e.g., "Frontend: UI screens, Backend: Node.js services").
    - Traceability Matrix: Table (e.g., `| R-001 | Frontend: chore-assignment.html | Backend: chore.js |`).

### 2.3. Screen Design Agent (SDA2)
- **Purpose**: Identify and design UI screens based on requirements.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Task 1: Screen Identification**
    - **Purpose**: Define screens for user actions/value delivery.
    - **Standards**: One screen per primary action, follow theming (#f8f9fa, #343a40, #007bff), include navigation.
    - **Dependencies**: Categorized requirements from RAA, components from SDA.
    - **Deliverable**: Screen list (text).
    - **Recipient**: UX Designer (refinement), Artifact Generation Agent (input).
  - **Deliverable Standards**:
    - Format: Text (e.g., "Screen: Chore Assignment - Purpose: Assign chores, Req: R-001").
    - Naming: Descriptive, hyphenated (e.g., `chore-assignment`).

### 2.4. Artifact Generation Agent (AGA)
- **Purpose**: Produce detailed artifacts for development and testing.
- **Tasks**:
  - **Task 1: Generate Wireframes**
    - **Purpose**: Create UI mockups for UX design.
    - **Standards**: HTML5 with inline CSS, follow Web Design Standard Document, map to screens.
    - **Dependencies**: Screen list from SDA2, requirements from RAA.
    - **Deliverable**: Wireframe files (e.g., `public/chore-assignment.html`).
    - **Recipient**: UX Designer.
  - **Task 2: Generate System Architecture**
    - **Purpose**: Define system structure for architecture planning.
    - **Standards**: Text or ASCII diagram, include all components and data flow.
    - **Dependencies**: Component list from SDA.
    - **Deliverable**: Architecture description.
    - **Recipient**: Solution Architect.
  - **Task 3: Generate Technical Specifications**
    - **Purpose**: Specify services and data models for development.
    - **Standards**: JSON or text, RESTful endpoints, MongoDB schemas.
    - **Dependencies**: Components and mapping from SDA.
    - **Deliverable**: Specs (e.g., `server/controllers/chore.js`).
    - **Recipient**: Tech Lead.
  - **Task 4: Generate Development Tasks**
    - **Purpose**: Break down work for developers.
    - **Standards**: Granular task list, map to components/screens.
    - **Dependencies**: Specs from Task 3, mapping from SDA.
    - **Deliverable**: Task list (text).
    - **Recipient**: Developer Lead.
  - **Task 5: Generate Test Cases**
    - **Purpose**: Define QA validation scenarios.
    - **Standards**: List with scenarios and acceptance criteria, cover benefit/objective.
    - **Dependencies**: Requirements from RAA, mapping from SDA.
    - **Deliverable**: Test case list (text).
    - **Recipient**: QA Lead.
  - **Deliverable Standards**:
    - Wireframes: Valid HTML5, inline CSS, in `public/`.
    - Architecture: Clear component/data flow (e.g., `[Frontend] --> [Backend]`).
    - Specs: JSON (e.g., `{"endpoint": "/api/assign-chore", "method": "POST"}`).
    - Tasks: List (e.g., `- Frontend: Add dropdown`).
    - Test Cases: Scenario format (e.g., `Given-When-Then`).

---

## 3. Dependencies and Coordination
- **RAA**: Depends on Stakeholders for raw requirements, feeds SDA and SDA2.
- **SDA**: Depends on RAA, feeds SDA2 and AGA.
- **SDA2**: Depends on RAA and SDA, feeds AGA.
- **AGA**: Depends on SDA and SDA2, delivers to all roles.
- **Coordination**: Product Owner oversees flow, ensuring artifacts align with requirements.

---

## 4. Standards for Deliverables
- **Format**: 
  - Wireframes: HTML5 files with inline CSS.
  - Architecture: Text or ASCII in a `.txt` file.
  - Specs: JSON or text in `server/controllers/`.
  - Tasks: Text list in a `.txt` file or inline documentation.
  - Test Cases: Text list in a `.txt` file.
- **Naming**: Kebab-case (e.g., `chore-assignment.html`), prefixed by directory (e.g., `server/controllers/chore.js`).
- **Consistency**: Follow MVC structure, theming (#f8f9fa, #343a40, #007bff), and traceability to requirements.
- **Completeness**: Each deliverable addresses its purpose (e.g., wireframes show UI, test cases verify benefit).

## 5. Usage by AI Agent
- **Context**: Provide this document to the AI agent team.
- **Instruction**: 
  - RAA: "Categorize the requirement and assign IDs."
  - SDA: "Decompose the system into components and map requirements."
  - SDA2: "Identify screens based on requirements and components."
  - AGA: "Generate artifacts (wireframes, architecture, specs, tasks, test cases) per the standards."
- **Input**: Requirement (description, benefit, objective, value).
- **Output**: Artifacts per role, stored in directories (e.g., `public/`, `server/`).

## 6. Example Application

### Requirement
- **ID**: R-001
- **Description**: "Users can assign chores to family members through a simple interface."
- **Benefit**: "Reduces task assignment time by 20%."
- **Objective**: "Streamline task delegation."
- **Value**: "Improves family coordination."

### Deliverables
#### RAA: Categorized Requirement
```json
[{"id": "R-001", "category": "UI", "description": "Users can assign chores...", "benefit": "Reduces task assignment time by 20%", "objective": "Streamline task delegation", "value": "Improves family coordination"}]
